The data set includes 63 sample points of bird species and variables (columns) of 48 habitat (environment) variables.  
More analytically, 
the first column is the name of bird species, next the 48 habitat variables measured at 164 sample points of a valley. These are 
organized into three logical groups: geomorphology (14 variables), landscape composition (20 variables) and landscape heterogeneity (14 variables).
The last column (NOBLOCKS) is the total number of detections of each bird at a series of visits at certain selected transects 
of the valey (same transects where the measurements of the 48 habitat measurements have been taken). For the working dataset 
exclude all cpecies (rows) that have been detected less that 4 times.
The measurements of environmental variables are the mean habitat conditions for each bird cpecies.

The aim of the project is to use cluster analysis to find groups of bird species that have
similar habitat associations on the basis of the variables provided. 

1. Use hierarchical and k means method to identify the group of species.  Assess the number of clusters
   and describe the group differences with respect to environmental conditions.
2. Instead of the original variables use principal components for the each group of environmental variables 
   (geomorphology, landscape composition and landscape heterogeneity).
3. Repeat step 1 for the PCs collected from the thee types of variables and add model based method for clustering.
4. Use factor analysis in a similar manner to step 2 and provide the factor or factors for each of the three invironmental variables. 
5. Provide plots (boxplots, scatter plots) on PCA and FA (Factor Analysis) scores to visulasize and describe similarities or differences 
   within and between bird species groups with respect to environmental conditions.

You have to submit the project by 7th of June via email.
